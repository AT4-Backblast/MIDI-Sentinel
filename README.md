This is the Midi-Sentinel Project

A midi controller with BOTH a joystick AND a thumbstick.
However, you are not limited to JUST these 2 XY controls.
You can have 2 Joysticks, or 2 thumbsticks or any combination
that you wish. You only need to modify the project to your needs.

BEFORE YOU START BUYING PARTS
The LCD screen and the Mainboard ARE DIFFERENT SIZES on 
prototype B than they are on prototype A. Make sure that the
filename prefixes MATCH in your LOCAL folder copy before you
start spending money!

In the DIY section, you will find "How-To" guides to build the
Midi Sentinel, step-by-step for each version of the Midi-Sentinel.
Along with separate parts lists for each version that includes
the original purchase source. (No guarantee that any particular
part will still be in stock on sites listed.)

In the Images section, you will find pictures of the different
versions so you know what you are looking for in the other sections.

In the CAD section, you will find the files for the early prototype
and the final Kickstarter version. The early kickstarter version
will be cheaper to make considering that the enclosure used was
NOT a custom designed enclosure, but an off the shelf enclosure
that you can buy online for around $20.
Also, worth noting. If you buy the "Off-the-shelf" enclosure, there
is NO usb mounting "hole" on the back. You will either need to cut
that out yourself or the website where it is sold has a fairly cheap
machining option where they will modify it for you before shipping.

In the EDA section, you will find the mainboard circuit board design
file and the knob controller circuit board file.  These can be uploaded
as they are to sites like PCBWay.com to be manufactured for about $5
per board. (Be aware though, PCBWay has a 5 board minimum per schematic.)

If you are here, it is because you are interested in either building
your own (DIY kit or self sourcing parts) or you want to modify the
one you have. Either way here is a short list of basic tools and
items that you should have before you start.

Soldering Iron, Solder, Flux pen or paste, spare wire, multimeter,
philips head screw driver, wire cutters, wire brush (for cleaning soldering iron)

Other tools may be required depending on what you are attempting.

Software needed, Arduino IDE.
